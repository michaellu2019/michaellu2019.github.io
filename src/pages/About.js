        <p>I don't mean to brag, but I excel at being average. As a senior at MIT studying electrical engineering and computer science 
          and mechanical engineering, I put the "me" in "mediocre." I've become an experienced amateur working at SpaceX, IBM, and ABB 
          in addition to working on some personal hobby projects like a robot donkey and Facebook chatbot. I guess in addition to doing 
          all that stuff I also enjoy some ordinary hobbies like running, cooking, doing volunteer firefighting and EMS, 
          watching movies, and sleeping. I'm also a big fan ofâ€”wait, do people even read these bios?</p>
