        <p>Created in December 2015, the Euclidean Project was a quick, intuitive, simple, digital geometry constructor made as a gift for my 9th grade geometry teacher (yeah, it was a while ago...). It was available for desktop and mobile users so that they could explore geometry stuffs on any device.</p>
