        <p>This little scrappy device was a homemade electric trash can vehicle built out of “trash”: scrap wood, cardboard, old cordless drills, and  wheelbarrow wheels. Intended to cause ripples in the modern transportation industry and revolutionize how we think of human-machine-augmented locomotion, this vehicle lasted about two days. What more do you expect from using $20 cordless drills as drive motors?</p>
